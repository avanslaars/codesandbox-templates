# CodeSandbox Templates

This is just a collection of template projects intended to be used with the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) CLI to quickly spin up new code samples. According to [the docs](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#export-with-cli), the CLI currently only works with projects based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so that's how each of these projects is setup.

## The Projects

* [Redux and Redux Observable](./redux-obs)
* [React and Rxjs](./react-rxjs)
